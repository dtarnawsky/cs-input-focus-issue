# Input Focus Issue
The input box show be displayed in the visible area when focused on a mobile device.

Note: In `step.component.html` on line 8 the `height` of 700px can be set to a little less than the height of your mobile device. This will simulate a form where the placement of the input box is in a "sweet spot" at the bottom of the screen causing Ionic's scroll assist to not function correctly.
